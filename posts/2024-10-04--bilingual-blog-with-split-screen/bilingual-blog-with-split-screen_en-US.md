# Bilingual Blog with Split Screen Layout

This article presents common phrases in English and another language! Pick two languages from the drop down select menu above if haven't already. A text is shown in a two column layout, one column for your native language and another one for the language you want to learn. The idea behind this bilingual reading experience is that you can challenge yourself in a foreign language without needing to look up missing vocabulary.

In this article you can check out common phrases in the language you select: [/blog/common-phrases-for-learning-a-language](/blog/common-phrases-for-learning-a-language).

In January 2016 I stumbled upon the language learning app Duolingo. I had fun trying it out, got hooked and learned the basics of French. I learned with the app for a few weeks or even month but then it got repetitive and boring. So, I stopped using it for long stretches of time until the famously attention-grabbing notifications pulled me back in; at least temporary.

![The notifications have been so obnoxiously optimized that many memes were created about them](./imgs/duolingo_notification_meme.jpg "meme: duolingo notification: Looks like you forgot your Spanish lessons again. You know what happens now! Security notification: Intruder Alert (Back Door). Proceed with caution.")

It's certainly a fun little tool for learning your first 500-1500 words and some basic grammar. However, it is not perfect. The problem is that you only engage with a single sentence in isolation. And these sentences are often nonsensical on purpose because it makes them more suprising and thus more memorable. [^1] The approach Duolingo takes has two downsides in my opinion:
    
1. You often learn vocabulary that is uncommon and useless for everyday conversations
2. Sentence are presented in isolation without the broader context of a larger piece of text. So, you don't really learn when and how to use phrases in the right context, i.e. everyday situations.

Here is an example of such a sentence, but you can also find many more on the internet:

> Tuvaletin içinde elli örümcek var.

> There are 50 spiders in you toilet.

it isn't too effective for advancing you formoving you to a stage where you can read foreign media like books, movies or video games.

these standalone sentence 
 after that, it just becomes boring doing the same small tasks over and over.

While I learned roughly 1.500 words in French and 500-750 words in Turkish (with a single 200 day streak), I had difficulties actually using the language, e.g. by reading a book. Also, it is not that easy to get media that is actually

I've also heard of other criticism, e.g. that the spaced-repition algorithm is not tight enough. So, using an Anki deck might be more effective. But digging into this is a topic for another article.

So, here is my attempt multi langauge blog . Some more phrases.
