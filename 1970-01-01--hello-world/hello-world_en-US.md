# Hello World

This is just an example blog post for myself to check formatting, typography and features like code highlighting or embeds. So, rather check out any other article on the [blog](/blog).

What does the term 'infrastructures' really mean? What do we incubate? Anything and everything, regardless of semidarkness! Our technology takes the best features of WAP and HTML. The capability to implement wirelessly leads to the capacity to harness without devaluing our power to deliver. We will disintermediate the power of returns-on-investment to monetize. Have you ever been unable to disintermediate your feature set? Without filling out any forms? If all of this comes off as mixed-up to you, that's because it is! What does it really mean to target virally than to harness mega-holistically.

It may seem confusing, but it's 100% realistic! What does the industry jargon 'co-branded' really mean? A company that can synthesize courageously will (eventually) be able to orchestrate correctly. What do we integrate? Anything and everything, regardless of namelessness! Our functionality is unparalleled, but our vertical, customized efficient, user-centric TQM and non-complex use is usually considered an amazing achievement. The capability to implement wirelessly leads to the capacity to enable perfectly leads to the capacity to synthesize interactively. In order to assess the 3rd generation blockchainâ€™s ability to whiteboard without lessening our aptitude to evolve without decreasing our power to deliver. If you incentivize dynamically, you may also reintermediate magnetically.

```js
let processor = unified()
    .use(remarkParse)    // parse into markdown syntax tree
    .use(remarkRehype)  // convert to html syntax tree
    .use(highlight) // adds class for syntax highlighting code blocks
    .use(rehypeStringify)      // turn html syntax tree to html

// process function will return the generated html string.
function processFile(filename) {
    // use vfile to read the file, could use fs if you like.
    return processor.processSync(vfile.readSync(filename));
}
```

```diff
/// file: svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';

export default {
	kit: {
-		adapter: adapter()
+		adapter: adapter({ out: 'my-output-directory' })
	}
};
```
